## Foo

```{mermaid}

  Foo     :active, magicstring, 2024-01, 2024-02 
```


## Magicstring

This header :point_up: is critical. If I change one character, the bug no
longer reproduces. It must match, case-insensitive, the ID of an element in the
Mermaid diagram.  Any string will work. Case doesn't matter.

**This slide will never be displayed; instead, the slide deck will loop from
the beginning.**

The content below this point doesn't matter.


# More slides!

Something!
